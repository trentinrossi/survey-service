# The first thing we need to do is define from what image we want to build from. 
# Here we will use the latest LTS (long term support) version 12 of node available from the Docker Hub:
FROM node:12

# Next we create a directory to hold the application code inside the image, this will be the 
# working directory for your application
# Create app directory
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# This image comes with Node.js and NPM already installed so the next thing we need to do is 
# to install your app dependencies using the npm binary. Please note that if you are using 
# npm version 4 or earlier a package-lock.json file will not be generated.
# Install app dependencies
# A wildcard is used to ensure both package.json AND package-lock.json are copied
# where available (npm@5+)
COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm install
# If you are building your code for production
# RUN npm ci --only=production

# To bundle your app's source code inside the Docker image, use the COPY instruction:
# Bundle app source
COPY . .

# Your app binds to port 4001 so you'll use the EXPOSE instruction to have it mapped by the docker daemon:
EXPOSE 4003

# Last but not least, define the command to run your app using CMD which defines your runtime. 
# Here we will use node server.js to start your server:
CMD [ "node", "./src/index.js" ]
